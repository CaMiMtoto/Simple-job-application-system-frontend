## System process flow
Consider that an applicant wants to submit his / her profile and CV


1 The HR is able to view the list of applicants 

2 That list should show only the first 10 items

3 And that list should be sorted alphabetically

4 The HR should be able to select an applicant and view his/her details

5 Last, the HR must have option to change the application status (Dropped, Passed)
